A simple weather forecast app using JavaScript and Bootstrap.

## Usage
On entering a city, the user is provided with a list of buttons with possible choices relating to their search. On selecting a button, another button is added to the history list, and the weather is provided for the current day as well as a forecast for the next five days. All weather cards contain the date, an icon, and a brief description, as well as the temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The user can then enter a new city, or click on city from the history list to see results for that city again.

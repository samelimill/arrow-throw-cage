A simple weather forecast app using JavaScript and Bootstrap.

## Usage
On entering a city, the user is provided with a list of buttons with possible choices relating to their search. On selecting a button, another button is added to the history list, and the weather forecast is provided for the current day as well as a forecast for the next five days.

## Process
I had originally used a CSS form in addition to the HTML and JavaScript forms, but eventually replaced those functions with Bootstrap functionality and a small amount of inline CSS styling for the background image and font.
